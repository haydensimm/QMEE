Theoretical context: The broader scientific question my data is trying to answer is; are there differences in the metabolic capacity of fish acclimated to different environmental variables, and do interactions exist between the environmental variables which place excessive stress on this metabolic capacity. It is hypothesized that conditions that cause relative increases metabolic rate, cold-acclimation and osmoregulation, will interact because of a co-dependency on regulation by thyroid-signalling. Conversely, conditions that place opposing demands on metabolism, for example warm-acclimation and osmoregulation, may also interaction because of the co-dependency. In order to test these questions the data must consider a repeatable and standardized way to measure metabolic rate, and the environments the animals were acclimated to. To address, metabolism, it was chosen to measure the rate at which the animals consumed oxygen from their tank water. This does not allow all of the metabolic processes to be measured as some are anereobic and do not require oxygen, but is most meaningful since the animals are aerobic and can only survive for very few minutes without adequate oxygen.
Measuring relevant attributes and scale: To measure the rate of oxygen consumption, the percentage of dissolved oxygen in the tank water was recorded on a continuous time series and therefore measured on a ratio scale. Another important metric was the mass of the fish. This was so that the metabolic rate could be standardized to the relative mass of the fish making the results repeatably comparable to other studies, which use other fish with non-identical mass. Again mass was measured on a ratio scale. Finally the environmental conditions were measured as ordinal values since the temperature and salinity of the environments are ordered labels and there is no consideration for the magnitude between values. Therefore, the data scales were assigned based on the theoretical context of the orignal question. 
Statistical analysis: Collectively, the metabolic rates will be grouped by the ordinal environmental characteristics to compare across groups for statisitcal analysis. This follows the theoretical context of the original question because it allows for comparisons across different environmental variables. As well, by separating the groups by high/low salinity and high/low temperature into four distinct treatments will allow for the considerations of interactions to answer the research question. This will facilitate statistical analysis to consider interactions because the effect of each environment can be considered alone by comparing across only a single variable (i.e. only temperature or salinity) and then both varibales by comparing groups that change both varib
I believe the only necessary transformation required is to standardize the oxygen consumption rates by mass, as in to divide the abolsute rate by mass.
