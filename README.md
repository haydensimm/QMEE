Data Description:
The data set is a part of a project titled "Characterizing the Interactive Effects of Temperature and Salinity Acclimation on the Thyroid Axis in Mummichog Killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus." The experimental design included acclimating fish to four combinations of saline (isosmotic and high-salinity) and temperature (cold and warm) conditons. Specifically, the data is a series of respiromerty experiments at each of the conditions where the oxygen content in a chamber containing a fish is continuously measured to quantify the oxygen consumption rate. By measuring oxygen consumption, the metabolic rate of the fish can thereby be determined, to monitor differences in metabolic demand across environments. The biological questions this data is seeking to answer are: are there differences in the metabolic capacity (resting metabolic rate, maximal metabolic rate and aerobic scope) between acclimation treatments, and if certain environments cause reduced metabolic capacity when acutely exposed to non-acclimation conditions. I hypothesize that acclimation to high-salinity will prevent the ability to properly acclimate to temperature, relative to isosmotic acclimation. I predict that this will be displayed in statistical differences in metabolic capicity between treatments because effective acclimation should compensate for the differences in metabolic demand across environments. If differences are present, I believe this is indicative of multiple stressors causing a breakdown in the ability to acclimate and subsequently reducing ecological fitness.
