The data set is a part of a project titled "Characterizing the Interactive Effects of Temperature and Salinity Acclimation on the Thyroid Axis in Mummichog Killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus." Specifically, the data is a series of respiromerty experiments where the oxygen content in a chamber containing a fish is continuously measured to quantify the oxygen consumption rate. By measuring oxygen consumption, the metabolic rate of the fish can thereby be determined, to monitor differences in metabolic demand across environments. The biological questions this data is seeking to answer are: are there differences in the metabolic capacity (resting metabolic rate, maximal metabolic rate and aerobic scope) 
acclimation should limit differences which indicates breakdown and reduced fitness
